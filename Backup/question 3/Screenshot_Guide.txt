INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSERTING SCREENSHOTS:
========================================

1. Open the generated Word document: News_Classification_Report.docx

2. For each [INSERT SCREENSHOT: ...] placeholder:
   a. Run the corresponding notebook cell to generate the visualization
   b. Take a screenshot or save the figure
   c. In Word, delete the placeholder text
   d. Insert the screenshot/image at that location
   e. Add a caption below the image (e.g., "Figure 1: Class Distribution of News Articles")

3. Ensure all screenshots are:
   - High resolution and clear
   - Properly sized to fit the page width
   - Centered on the page
   - Have descriptive captions

4. Recommended image format: PNG or JPG

5. If you have saved figures from the notebook, you can insert them directly instead of taking screenshots.
